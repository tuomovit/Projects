Including school projects and my own stuff

My own projects:

• KorkoaKorolle
  - Calculator, which calculate compound interest of users values. Made by HTML/CSS/JS,
  and it draws diagram with Chart.js library. Not ready yet, but the functions works.
  
• Tumijovisivu
  - My own homepage, light and fast. The principle are was to make a nice page mostly with
  only HTML/CSS, and very little bit of JavaScript. Works OK on the phone and the computer.

School stuff:

• TIEA2120 Web-käyttöliittymien ohjelmointi
  - Course where we used mostly JavaScript and make navigation program with JSON-database.
